  In English, Blah is a word that is sometimes used to express words or feelings where the specifics are not considered important to the speaker or writer for emotions. It is not often seen in formal writing, except when transcribing speech. It differs from a speech disfluency such as "um" or "er" in that blah is a word used deliberately to represent other words, rather than as an accidental or temporary interjection  into speech. Blah is also used when the speaker cannot say what was intended. It also is used for disagreeing, almost like the word "balderdash". "Blah" is also mimed behind people's backs to suggest that they talk too much or that they talk about useless topics for no reason (an example of this would be saying, "Blah blah blah, he just goes on and on"). The word "Blah" can also be used in a mocking or sarcastic tone. "Blah" is used in some circumstances as a sign of impatience and arrogance towards another. Blah is also used to refer to the state of boredom.
  
  "Blah" is a token word with no meaning of its own, usually used to illustrate generic, boring speech. It may be used to fill in blank space, or to replace another word/phrase. It's for this last purpose that blah is sometimes assumed to mean absolutely nothing but sometimes something negative because it is used to replace a word that may be unpleasant, but blah itself is neutral. If spoken aloud the tone can usually be used to determine the speaker's intent.
